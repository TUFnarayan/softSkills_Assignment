1. Interpersonal Skills
During a group project in college, a teammate misunderstood my feedback and felt I was criticizing their work. Instead of reacting defensively, I approached them privately and clarified my intention. I acknowledged their effort and explained that my suggestions were meant to improve our final outcome. I used empathy and open body language to show I valued their contribution. We discussed the issue calmly, and I encouraged them to share their perspective. This helped rebuild trust and improved our collaboration. By practicing active listening and respectful communication, we resolved the misunderstanding and completed the project successfully. It taught me that interpersonal skills like empathy, patience, and clarity are essential for maintaining harmony and productivity in any team setting.

2. Communication Skills
Active listening involves fully concentrating, understanding, and responding thoughtfully to what someone is saying. It includes maintaining eye contact, nodding, asking clarifying questions, and avoiding interruptions. Passive listening, on the other hand, is hearing without engagement—often distracted or disinterested. Active listening improves team communication by fostering trust and reducing misunderstandings. When team members feel heard, they’re more likely to share ideas and collaborate effectively. For example, during a team meeting, actively listening to a colleague’s concerns can help identify issues early and find solutions together. It also encourages inclusivity and boosts morale, making the team more cohesive and productive.

3. Workplace Etiquette
Three key examples of professional behaviour in the workplace are punctuality, respectful communication, and accountability.

Punctuality shows reliability and respect for others’ time.

Respectful communication—whether with peers or supervisors—creates a positive and inclusive environment.

Accountability means owning your tasks and mistakes, which builds trust and credibility. These behaviours are important because they reflect your professionalism and influence how others perceive and interact with you. They also contribute to a healthy work culture where collaboration and mutual respect thrive. Demonstrating these consistently can lead to better opportunities and stronger workplace relationships.

5. Behaviour at Workplace
When receiving critical feedback from a supervisor, an employee should respond with openness and professionalism. For example, if a supervisor points out delays in task completion, the employee should listen attentively, avoid defensiveness, and thank them for the input. They can then explain any challenges faced and propose a plan to improve. In one instance, I was told my reports lacked clarity. I acknowledged the feedback, asked for specific suggestions, and revised my format based on their advice. This not only improved my work but also showed my willingness to grow. Accepting feedback positively demonstrates maturity, builds trust, and helps in continuous improvement.
